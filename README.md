# Principles of Data Analytics

by Mariane McGrath

# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains practical exercises and code implementations for fundamental data analysis concepts. It serves as a hands-on companion to theoretical principles and covers essential data manipulation, visualisation, and analysis techniques.

## Notebook Structure
The notebook is organised into clear sections, each focusing on a specific data analysis task or concept.

### Task 1
- Sourcing the Data Set
### Task 2
- Exploring the Data Structure
### Task 3
- Summarising the Data
### Task 4
- Visualising Features
### Task 5
- Investigating Relationships
### Task 6
- Analysing Class Distributions
### Task 7
- Boxplots of Petal lengths
### Task 8
- Correlation Heatmap
### Task 9
 - Coefficient of determination R^2
### Task 10
- Pairplot of the dataset
